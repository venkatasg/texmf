# texmf

A collection of my personal LaTeX templates, inspired by Matthew Butterick's [Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com)

Currently, I have the following templates:

- **Practical Report**
- **Practical Presentation**
- **Practical Poster**
- **Practical Letter**

These use Butterick's fonts through LuaLaTeX &mdash; you should replace them with fonts of your choice if you don't have those installed.
