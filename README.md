# texmf

A collection of my personal LaTeX templates, inspired by Matthew Butterick's [Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com)

Currently, I have the following templates:

- **Practical Report**
- **Practical Presentation**
- **Practical Poster**
- **Practical Letter**

These use [Matthew Butterick's fonts](https://mbtype.com) and are compiled with [LuaTeX](http://www.luatex.org).

You can see documents using the report and letter template on [my academic job  materials repository](https://github.com/venkatasg/academic-job-apps). For documents using the poster and presentation template, click [the slide and poster links on this page](https://venkatasg.net/papers).
